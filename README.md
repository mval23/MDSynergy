Prompt 1:

1. Optimize the following Python code for both memory usage and performance. Please use specific techniques or code changes to make it more efficient. Provide just the code as an answer, I don't need any explanation. Here's the code snippet:
2. Please analyze and optimize the following code for performance, considering both time and memory efficiency. Identify areas where improvements can be made and provide a revised version of the code that demonstrates these optimizations. Please give me just the optimized code. Here's the code I need to optimize:
3. I was given with the task to optimize a code taking into account time, memory and performance of it. With the code given, search and made the changes that you consider necessary to improve the performance of the code. I need in your answer the new code, and the information of the execution time and the memory usage in an average case before and after the changes you just made. Here is the code:
4. Please optimize the given code to improve its performance while maintaining its functionality. Consider techniques such as code refactoring, algorithmic improvements, and resource utilization to make it more efficient. The output just need to be the optimized code, anything else. Here's the code to improve:
5. Please optimize the given code for maximum performance while maintaining its functionality. Consider factors such as runtime efficiency, memory usage, and any other relevant performance metrics. Your goal is to make the code as fast and resource-efficient as possible. Here is the code that you need to check, please just put at the output the new code that has been already review.
